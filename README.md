# DS-Exercise1
To run the code in this repository you will need to have access to a machine running python, with the corresponding libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.

Once the dependencies are installed, start the jupyter notebook server via "jupyter notebook" command in the folder that has been cloned.

In this folder, the notebook "vaccine_correlations.ipynb" can be found, which needs to be accessed. 

In this notebook, there is a script of few code blocks. These can be run using the combination Shift+Enter, which will open the two .csv files and read them in dataframes. A set of new columns will be generated based on the values of the vaccination rates and the change in the number of new daily cases and merged into a final dataframe.

Two sets of visualizations will be generated, regarding correlations between the vaccination rate and how it affects the daily number of new cases in Israel. This dataframe will be stored in a .csv file as well.
